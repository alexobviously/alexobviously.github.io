Some of the things I might be able to help you with:

### Technical Audit

It's fairly common, especially at startups, for a project to hit a point where it is doesn't seem to be progressing as expected. Sometimes it's due to miscommunication between engineering and management. Sometimes it's the result of an early architectural choice that doesn't scale well with the direction of the project.  
<br>

Whatever the reason, I may be able to help you identify the cause and develop a plan of action to get back up to speed. I have years of experience working with small businesses, helping them make decisions that get them past roadblocks.  
<br>

The contents of a technical audit vary based on the situation, but generally it will go something like:
* Conversations with stakeholders to establish expectations and formalise the issues at hand.
* Broad evaluation of initial plans, and comparison with the current state of the project.
* Broad overview of the technical components of the project.
* Detailed evaluation of problem areas identified in the previous steps.
* Recommendations for how to proceed.

### Dart/Flutter Guidance and Coaching

There's a high adoption rate of Dart and Flutter for new software, and with many existing apps transitioning to Flutter. If your team is considering building an application with Flutter and want guidance on an optimal solution, I will be able to help you. I can help a team of existing developers find their footing in their new framework, and start building with greater speed.  
<br>

I have planned and built many apps in Flutter, and written a number of open source libraries, some of them fairly popular. My knowledge of Dart is deep and nuanced, and I can help you write clean, efficient code, and hopefully cultivate a love for Dart and Flutter like I have.   
<br>

Another category of work I get a lot of is clients who have a Flutter app, and want to incorporate some fairly difficult feature that needs special attention. I can help you!   
Some examples of things like this I've helped with: [an efficient 3D model viewport for a health app](https://inuba.com/en/), [a customisable AI for a chess app](https://twoplayerchess.com), processing of user microphone audio, and a responsive streaming system that can handle many videos at once.

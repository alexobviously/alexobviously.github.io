# Alex Baker

I teach sand how to think.

Started out writing mods for games as a wee sprog, backend/web as a teenager, studied music technology, worked in AI for a bit, somehow became specialised in chess and language learning too. Now I primarily make Dart backends and Flutter apps, but I'm always experimenting with and open to new things.  

My language of choice is Dart 🎯, and I also like Rust 🦀.  
I create and maintain a number of open source packages for Dart and Flutter.  

Originally from Manchester, UK. Currently living in Vietnam with my wife and 11 cats.

My day job is principal engineer at a medtech company doing good things. I also make cool projects with my mates at [Goodpals](https://goodpals.dev).

#### <a id="about" href="#about">Hi, I'm Alex, an educator of sand.</a>

Started out writing mods for games as a wee sprog, backend/web as a teenager, studied music technology, worked in AI for a bit, somehow became specialised in chess and language learning too. Now I primarily make Dart backends and Flutter apps, but I'm always experimenting with and open to new things.  

My language of choice is Dart 🎯, and I also like Rust 🦀.  
I create and maintain a number of [open source packages](/#open-source) for Dart and Flutter.  

Originally from Manchester, UK. Currently living in Vietnam with my wife and 7 cats.
